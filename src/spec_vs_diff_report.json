      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Fix the celebration view so the final uploaded photo reliably loads from static assets using a valid file path under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (matching the actual filename and extension) rather than a broken/missing reference.",
      "reason": "The updated uploaded-photo `src` points to `/assets/20250912_152552.jpg`, which is not under `/assets/generated/` as required, and the diff does not show adding or referencing a file under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` for the uploaded photo.",
